The program emulates the game TIS-100 by Zachtronics.
The program reads in mock assembly language code that performs sepcific task on a set of number to produce a set of outputs.

The program first waits for a list of commands to be pasted into the command promt.
Once the list of commands has been pasted, the program reads and structures the information for proper GUI creation.
The program will launch a GUI with the title screen and a start button.
Upon clicking the start button the gui will populate with the proper number of silos and ports.
On the bottom left side of the screen, a set of controls are available for the user to interact with.
The left side also shows the set of inputs and a second area where outputs will be populated in real time.
The GUI runs and updates in real time as the player can run the code and see how far it has come along.


The .jar file is self-sufficient and contains the resources within.
